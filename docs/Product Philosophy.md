I am not just forking — I am *forging ahead*.

Here exactly **what my Zettelkasten AI plugin will do that neither Rocketnotes nor Smart Connections fully deliver.**

---

## 🧠 Unique Value Proposition of *my Plugin*

### ✅ 1. **Zettelkasten-Aware Link *Reasoning***

> Not just “what to link,” but **why** it should be linked — explained in plain English.

- **Smart Connections** finds similar notes (embedding-based) but doesn't explain *why* a connection matters.
- **my plugin** adds *intentionality*: GPT will **justify** each suggested link based on the concepts, tags, and note roles.

```yaml
ai_links:
  - to: "Affordance Theory"
    reason: "This note expands on 'perceptual action coupling', referenced in the current note under 'Embodied Design'"
```

This is **perfect for Zettelkasten**, where each link is part of a personal reasoning chain.

### ✅ 2. **Auto-Splitting into Atomic Notes (GPT-Powered)**

> Turn sprawling ideas into tight, linkable “atoms” with proper backlinks.

- **Rocketnotes** lets you store and chat with my notes but doesn’t manage note structure.
- **my plugin**:
  - Detects multiple ideas in a single note
  - Splits them into titled sub-notes
  - Rewires the backlinks for full ZK integrity

This helps maintain **atomicity**, a core Zettelkasten principle.

---

### ✅ 3. **Link Suggestion Based on *Existing Vault Link Graph***

> Leverages *my* personal link structure to contextualize AI actions.

- **Smart Connections** uses embeddings → it might miss crucial *manual* links or notes you’ve curated intentionally.
- **my plugin**:
  - Reads incoming/outgoing links and tags
  - Prioritizes link suggestions that *respect my vault’s logic*
  - Avoids overlinking by using existing structures as a guide

It **blends semantic search with human-curated topology**.

---

### ✅ 4. **Link Proposal Logging with YAML or Comment Blocks**

> Keeps AI-generated decisions *visible*, *editable*, and *revocable*.

- Neither Rocketnotes nor Smart Connections expose AI link suggestions in a persistent, editable format.
- Iwill:
  - Propose links in a `%%AI_LINKS%%` block or YAML
  - Allow users to review, accept, or discard
  - Store reasoning and confidence

That’s **transparent AI** + futureproofing.

---

### ✅ 5. **Plugin Interoperability + Extensibility**

> Designed to *interface with Smart Connections* and *Rocketnotes* if present.

- Reuse:
  - `window['SmartSearch']` from Smart Connections
  - Embedding indexes from either
  - Chunking utilities from Rocketnotes
- But: Provide my own overrideable modules, so advanced users can plug in **their own models** or **change chunking strategies**

That makes my plugin **both flexible and collaborative**.
